Kumar, CPM-15, CPM-17 and TNBC Datasets

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each ground truth file is stored as a .mat file, with the key 'inst_map', which contains the instance segmentation annotation.


The instance segmentation annotation gives a unique integer for each individual nucleus. i.e the map ranges from 0 to N, where 0 is the background and N is the number of nuclei.
