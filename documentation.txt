DATA Changes: 

Ignoring file - TCGA-P4-AAVK-01Z-00-DX1_6 (173, 74, 3) as it's size is even less than patch size. Losing about 5 (*4 = 20) annotations. 

DATASET SELECTION:

MoNuSAC specifies WS are taken from 4 organs: Breast, kidney, lung and prostate, but does not specify the distribution.

	Train - everything else

@ TO DOs:

Loss Function Changes

	In the Cross Entropy (& Jaccard component) Loss for NC & NP, weight the classes according to organizer class weights. Minority class gets 10 times the weight. Or something like that. Or maybe just Panoptic Quality itself....?
	Use Jac card Index in Loss Function for Classification, and not DICE

Post Processing of Output

	Marker M generation for thr3shokding function - choose thresholds b and k again.

Pre Processing of Annotations

	Annotations

		Computing the Distance to Centre of Mass of each Nuclear Annotation Boundary will be important
		Axes will have zero distance in complementary maps.

	*Range is - 1 to 1 for distances.
	*Consider using Gaussian Distribution rather than a rigid - 1 to 1.

Neural Network Architecture

	Patch Size, Downsampling/Upsampling degree
